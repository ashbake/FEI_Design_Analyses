The goal of this analysis is to 

(1) plot the tracking camera tip tilt rates possible as a function of star magnitude for a few SNR cutoffs (20,50,100)

(2) Summarize the dynamic tip tilts that the AO system provides for various modes before/after added TT correction by the HISPEC tracking loop. KPIC sees 6-7 mag (uncorrected) at least up to 8th mag with the shack-hartmann
