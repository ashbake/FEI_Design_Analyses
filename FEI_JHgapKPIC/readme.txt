KPIC filters show that when PyPO is in DS mode, not much light goes through (10% in everything by K band, 90% of J,H go to pyramid). J and H bands transmit 20% J and H, let through 100% of JH gap and other light. So if PyPO is in J band, then J light goes to pyramid and rest goes through


So for 4/18 data, should compare frame 8 and frame 14, both have PyPO as J band 

For 4/17 data compare frame 5 (PyPO in J band) and frame
